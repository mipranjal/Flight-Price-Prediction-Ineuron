# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction Project 

Welcome to the Flight Price Prediction project! 🚀 In this project, we aim to predict flight ticket prices based on various features like date of journey, departure time, arrival time, duration, airlines, source, and destination.


## 📝 Description

This project is a part of the iNeuron Internship program. We explore a dataset containing flight information and perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building using the RandomForestRegressor algorithm. The goal is to create a reliable model that can accurately predict flight ticket prices for various routes and airlines.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

The project was built using:

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🌊
- Scikit-learn 🧠

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
- datasets/             # Contains the dataset files
- static/                # Contains css files and images used in the project
- templates/              # Contains the Html files 
- models/                # Contains saved trained models
- Flight_Price_Prediction.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook with the project code
- flight_rf.pkl          # Pickle file containing the trained model (you can make this model by running the above jupyter file)
- README.md              # You are here 😉
```

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `flight_price.ipynb` using Jupyter.
4. Follow along with the code and **execute** the cells to explore, preprocess, and build the model.
5. Enjoy **predicting flight ticket prices** with your trained model!
